INSTALL
-------

You will need to install VCG to use the graphical output from this module.
However to generate VCG notation files you do not need to install VCG itself.

To install VCG.pm you will need IPC::Run

# perl -MCPAN -e 'install IPC::Run'

% perl Makefile.PL
% make
% make test
% su
# make install


any problems email vcg.pm@droogs.org
